# Preface {.unnumbered}

I decided to learn R in late 2020 for a variety of reasons, including the reasons that I lay out in section \@ref(why-r): R is open source, free, and powerful. Early on in my studies, I decided that going forward I would also teach my introductory undergraduate course "Scope and Methods of Political Science" using R instead of SPSS (which I had used in the past), for those same reasons -- it would be great for my students to get some experience with this powerful piece of software.

As I reviewed the available workbooks, I did not find one that I was satisfied with. <a href="https://www.carlypotznielsen.com/">Carly Potz-Nielsen</a> has written a terrific workbook with a colleague of hers which she shared with me. I considered using that, but ultimately, I decided to write my own workbook to fit the way that I have come to teach Scope and Methods. I also wanted to write an R workbook that uses the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a> package, because I think that is a great way to use R.

I decided to make my workbook available for free online because that is consistent with the open source spirit of R. This workbook might be helpful to you if you are trying to teach yourself R, and you are also welcome to use it to teach students R in non-profit high schools and non-profit collegiate settings. Those wishing to use it for commercial reasons outside of non-profit educational uses should contact me for permission.

I'd like to thank my spouse Kate for coming up with the great title and for putting up with my (admittedly annoying) regular, enthusiastic discussion of the new things that I had learned to do and make in R over these last few years.

# About the author {.unnumbered}

I am <a href="https://www.michaelstrausz.com/">Michael Strausz</a>, a Professor and the Chair of the <a href="https://addran.tcu.edu/political-science/index.php">Political Science Department at Texas Christian University</a>. I am the author of the 2019 book <a href="https://www.michaelstrausz.com/book">Help (Not) Wanted: Immigration Politics in Japan</a> and the editor of the forthcoming book <a href= "https://uhpress.hawaii.edu/title/no-island-is-an-island-perspectives-on-immigration-to-japan/">No Island is an Island: Perspectives on Immigration to Japan</a>. My research focuses on Japan’s immigration policy and as the role of norms in international politics. I teach a variety of courses in comparative politics, international relations, research methods, and Asian studies. 

I graduated from Michigan State University’s James Madison College and earned my Ph.D. in political science from the University of Washington in Seattle. I live just outside of Fort Worth, Texas with my spouse and our two children. In my free time, I enjoy cooking, hiking, and schmoozing.

# What's new in version 2.0? {.unnumbered}

The first version of this workbook was a series of PDFs that I uploaded to <a href="https://www.michaelstrausz.com/">my website</a> in April 2022. Those were a bit clunky. They were difficult for students to copy code chunks out of (the formatting would get strange) and they were also difficult for me to update. In April 2023, I created a version of this workbook as a single website. I actually did this as I was teaching a class that used the workbook, so the students switched from PDFs to a website in the middle of the class. It was very dramatic!

I continued to make small updates and corrections to the workbook regularly, but for Version 2.0 I read over the whole workbook, clarifying various explanations and fixing errors. I added section \@ref(case-when), which explains a more precise way of simplifying interval variables than was in earlier versions of the workbook (although the other ways of simplifying interval variables are still there, in section \@ref(cut-2)). I also added section \@ref(export-crosstabs), which explains how to export cross-tabulation tables and other tables generated in R in a format that is easy to bring into word processors. Finally, I added a voter turnout variable to the ANES dataset, as many of my students are interested in the question of "who votes?"
