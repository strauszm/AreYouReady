# Preface {.unnumbered}

I decided to learn R in late 2020 for a variety of reasons, including the reasons that I lay out in section \@ref(why-r): R is open source, free, and powerful. Early on in my studies, I decided that going forward I would also teach my introductory undergraduate course "Scope and Methods of Political Science" using R instead of SPSS (which I had used in the past), for those same reasons -- it would be great for my students to get some experience with this powerful piece of software.

As I reviewed the available workbooks, I did not find one that I was satisfied with. <a href="https://www.carlypotznielsen.com/">Carly Potz-Nielsen</a> has written a terrific workbook with a colleague of hers which she shared with me. I considered using that, but ultimately, I decided to write my own workbook to fit the way that I have come to teach Scope and Methods. I also wanted to write an R workbook that uses the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a> package, because I think that is a great way to use R.

I decided to make my workbook available for free online because that is consistent with the open source spirit of R. This workbook might be helpful to you if you are trying to teach yourself R, and you are also welcome to use it to teach students R in non-profit high schools and non-profit collegiate settings. Those wishing to use it for commercial reasons outside of non-profit educational uses should contact me for permission.

I'd like to thank my spouse Kate for coming up with the great title and for putting up with my (admittedly annoying) regular, enthusiastic discussion of the new things that I had learned to do and make in R over these last few years.

# About the author {.unnumbered}

I am <a href="https://www.michaelstrausz.com/">Michael Strausz</a>, a professor of political science at Texas Christian University. I am the author of the 2019 book <a href="https://www.michaelstrausz.com/book">Help (Not) Wanted: Immigration Politics in Japan</a> and the editor of the forthcoming book <a href= "https://uhpress.hawaii.edu/title/no-island-is-an-island-perspectives-on-immigration-to-japan/">No Island is an Island: Perspectives on Immigration to Japan</a>. My research focuses on Japan’s immigration policy and as the role of norms in international politics. I teach a variety of courses in comparative politics, international relations, research methods, and Asian studies. 

I graduated from Michigan State University’s James Madison College and earned my Ph.D. in political science from the University of Washington in Seattle. I live just outside of Fort Worth, Texas with my spouse and our two children. In my free time, I enjoy cooking, hiking, and schmoozing.
